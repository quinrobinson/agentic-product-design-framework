# Agentic Product Design Framework

A scalable, AI-integrated framework for product and UX design — from research through delivery. Built as a living system that evolves with your practice and scales with any project.

## Live Website

The interactive tools are deployed as a website via GitHub Pages:

**[quinrobinson.github.io/agentic-product-design-framework](https://quinrobinson.github.io/agentic-product-design-framework)**

No install needed — open in any browser and share the URL with your team. The site is organized as five entry paths into the framework — **by phase**, **by task** (Quickstarts), **by agent**, **by skill**, or **by scenario** — plus a **system map** that visualizes how everything connects.

---

## How It Works

The framework is built around six phases — **Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver** — each backed by a structured skill file you upload to Claude.

1. **Pick your phase** — Start where your project is right now, or use the Kickoff Prompt below to get oriented
2. **Upload a skill file** — Drop the relevant `.md` file into a Claude conversation to activate phase-specific workflows, templates, and quality checklists
3. **Do the work** — Claude follows structured outputs; you review, direct, and decide
4. **Start designing** — Open any phase and create. Research, concepts, wireframes, specs — the framework meets you where you are. Use the Phase Handoff Block at the end of each phase to carry full context into the next conversation.

The [live site](https://quinrobinson.github.io/agentic-product-design-framework) has interactive tools for exploring the system, previewing design tokens, and auditing design systems. Bring your own Figma files — Claude reads and writes against them directly via Figma MCP.

## Before You Start

- **Claude access** — A claude.ai account (free tier works; Pro recommended for longer sessions)
- **Figma** — Optional but recommended. For MCP integration (Claude reading and writing against your own Figma files), you'll need Claude Desktop or Claude Code + the Figma desktop app. See the in-app Figma Setup Guide for full steps.
- **Skill files** — Available in `/skills`. Upload whichever phase you're starting in — or use the Kickoff Prompt below if you're not sure

## Claude Code Setup (Pathlon plugin)

Claude Chat with a skill file gets you most of the framework. Claude Code with the Pathlon plugin adds the rest: every skill, six specialist agents, `/pathlon:*` commands, and project state that persists across sessions and surfaces in Pathlon MCP.

```
/plugin marketplace add quinrobinson/agentic-product-design-framework
/plugin install pathlon@pathlon
```

That's the whole setup. The plugin connects to Pathlon MCP (`mcp.pathlon.io`) automatically; project state — phase, decisions, handoffs — lives there, not in local files. Start a project with `/pathlon:kickoff`.

The plugin source is in [`/pathlon`](./pathlon). To try local changes without installing: `claude --plugin-dir ./pathlon`.

## Kickoff Prompt

**Not sure where to start? Paste this into a new Claude conversation.**

No skill file needed yet — Claude will orient itself to the framework, ask you four questions, and tell you exactly where to start and what to do first.

```
You are a UX design assistant trained on the Agentic Product Design Framework —
a six-phase system (Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver)
with structured skill files and AI-ready prompts for each phase.

The six phases and their skill files are:
- Discover → research-planning.md, research-synthesis.md, competitive-analysis.md, service-blueprint.md, insight-framing.md
- Define → problem-framing.md, journey-mapping.md, persona-creation.md, assumption-mapping.md, requirements-prioritization.md
- Ideate → concept-generation.md, concept-proof.md, visual-design-execution.md, concept-critique.md, idea-clustering.md, storyboarding.md
- Prototype → prototyping.md, user-flow-mapping.md, ux-copy-writing.md, prototype-scoping.md, heuristic-review.md, test-script-drafting.md, accessibility-audit.md
- Validate → usability-testing.md, usability-findings-synthesis.md, insight-report.md, recruitment-screener.md, stakeholder-presentation.md, iteration-brief.md
- Deliver → design-delivery.md, component-specs.md, design-qa.md, handoff-annotation.md, accessibility-annotation.md, design-decision-record.md, design-system-audit.md
- Cross-phase → design-systems.md, figma-playbook.md, phase-handoff.md, skill-chaining.md, which-claude.md

I'm starting a new design project and need help getting oriented.
Please ask me the following four questions (all at once is fine):

1. What type of project is this?
   (e.g., new product, feature addition, redesign, internal tool, client work)

2. What phase are you entering?
   (Discover / Define / Ideate / Prototype / Validate / Deliver — or "not sure")

3. What do you have so far?
   (nothing yet / a brief / a brief + research / existing designs)

4. Are you working solo or with a team?

Based on my answers, respond with:
- Recommended starting phase and a one-sentence reason why
- The specific skill file to upload next (exact filename)
- A suggested first deliverable — specific, not a category
- One prompt I can use right now, before uploading anything, to get started
```

## What's Inside

### `/skills` — Claude Skill Files

43 structured `.md` skill files — organized by phase, covering the full design lifecycle from research through delivery. Browse, preview, and download from the [Skills Library](https://quinrobinson.github.io/agentic-product-design-framework) on the live site.

| Phase | Skills | Files |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 01 — Discover | 5 | `research-planning.md`, `research-synthesis.md`, `competitive-analysis.md`, `service-blueprint.md`, `insight-framing.md` |
| 02 — Define | 5 | `problem-framing.md`, `journey-mapping.md`, `persona-creation.md`, `assumption-mapping.md`, `requirements-prioritization.md` |
| 03 — Ideate | 6 | `concept-generation.md`, `concept-proof.md`, `visual-design-execution.md`, `concept-critique.md`, `idea-clustering.md`, `storyboarding.md` |
| 04 — Prototype | 7 | `prototyping.md`, `accessibility-audit.md`, `user-flow-mapping.md`, `ux-copy-writing.md`, `prototype-scoping.md`, `heuristic-review.md`, `test-script-drafting.md` |
| 05 — Validate | 6 | `usability-testing.md`, `usability-findings-synthesis.md`, `insight-report.md`, `recruitment-screener.md`, `stakeholder-presentation.md`, `iteration-brief.md` |
| 06 — Deliver | 7 | `design-delivery.md`, `component-specs.md`, `design-qa.md`, `handoff-annotation.md`, `accessibility-annotation.md`, `design-decision-record.md`, `design-system-audit.md` |
| Cross-phase | 7 | `design-systems.md`, `figma-playbook.md`, `figma-ds-export.md`, `figma-ds-audit.md`, `phase-handoff.md`, `skill-chaining.md`, `which-claude.md` |

### `/pathlon/agents` — Specialist Agents

Six pre-configured Claude agents, each scoped to a role in the design process. Available in Claude Code through the Pathlon plugin as `pathlon:*` subagents (auto-spawned by the Orchestrator) or in any Claude conversation by uploading the agent file. Every agent declares a **Primary Goal** (one-sentence outcome commitment) and a **Definition of Done** (checkable completion criteria) at the top of its file, so each agent knows what "finished" looks like before it starts.

| Agent | File | Primary Surface | When to Invoke |
|-------|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Orchestrator** | `orchestrator.md` | Code + Chat | Start of a project, phase transitions, or when you're not sure which agent to use. Spawns specialist agents in Claude Code. |
| **Researcher** | `researcher.md` | Chat | Any research activity — planning a study, synthesizing transcripts, competitive analysis, or findings reports. |
| **Strategist** | `strategist.md` | Chat | Translating research into problem frames, journey maps, personas, and stakeholder presentations. |
| **Designer** | `designer.md` | Chat | Concept generation, idea clustering, flow mapping, UX copy, and concept proofs. |
| **Systems Designer** | `systems-designer.md` | Code | Component architecture, token systems, design system audits, and Figma variable scaffolding. |
| **Design Engineer** | `design-engineer.md` | Code + Cowork | Handoff docs, design QA, accessibility annotations, and building component code from specs. |

**In Claude Code:** Install the Pathlon plugin (above). The Orchestrator auto-spawns agents based on phase — run `/pathlon:kickoff` to start, `/pathlon:route` to see what's next, and `/pathlon:transition` to close a phase. Project state comes from Pathlon MCP.

**In Claude Chat or any conversation:** Upload the agent's `.md` file, or copy the activation prompt from the [Agents page](https://quinrobinson.github.io/Agentic-Product-Design-Framework) on the live site.

### `/artifacts` — Interactive React Components & Onboarding Deck

Five JSX artifacts that render as interactive tools, plus a team onboarding presentation:

- **`design-process-system.jsx`** — Clickable phase-by-phase system with AI prompts, skill docs, templates, and tool recommendations per phase
- **`design-tokens-system.jsx`** — Universal starter design system with tunable tokens, live component previews, presets, and AI-powered customization export
- **`design-system-checklist.jsx`** — Comprehensive audit checklist synthesized from Material Design 3, Atlassian, IBM Carbon, and Apple HIG — with Figma-ready prompts per item
- **`m3-token-reference.jsx`** — Interactive M3 token documentation for Button, Card, Text Field, and Navigation Bar — covers color roles, elevation, shape, typography, and spacing with Figma variable spec prompts
- **`onboarding-deck.pptx`** — 18-slide team onboarding presentation covering the framework's value, structure, and step-by-step setup. Designed to match the Figma Cover aesthetic: dark/light slide balance, phase colors (01–06) used consistently throughout.

### Figma MCP

This framework is designed to work against **your own Figma files** — not a template. The agents and skill files reference Figma MCP read/write operations so Claude can audit, scaffold, and update components directly in the files you're already working in. See the in-app **Figma Setup Guide** for the one-time MCP connection setup (Claude Code + Figma desktop + personal access token).

## The Design Process

```
Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver
   ↑                                              |
   └──────────── Iterate as needed ←──────────────┘
```

## AI Leverage Levels

Each skill is tagged with an AI leverage level:

- **High** — AI handles the heavy lifting (synthesis, generation, documentation). You review, refine, and direct.
- **Medium** — AI assists with structure and drafts. You bring judgment, context, and strategic thinking.
- **Low** — Fundamentally human skills (empathy, taste, stakeholder navigation). AI supports but doesn't replace.

## Contributing

To add or modify skills:
1. Follow the frontmatter format (`name`, `phase`, `description`, `ai_leverage`)
2. Include structured templates with clear `[PLACEHOLDERS]`
3. Add a quality checklist at the end of every skill
4. Keep skills actionable — workflows, not theory
