# Agentic Product Design Framework

A scalable, AI-integrated framework for product and UX design — from research through delivery. Built as a living system that evolves with your practice and scales with any project.

## Live Website

The interactive tools are deployed as a website via GitHub Pages:

**[quinrobinson.github.io/Agentic-Product-Design-Framework](https://quinrobinson.github.io/Agentic-Product-Design-Framework)**

No install needed — open in any browser and share the URL with your team.

---

## How It Works

The framework is built around six phases — **Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver** — each backed by a structured skill file you upload to Claude.

1. **Pick your phase** — Start where your project is right now, or use the Kickoff Prompt below to get oriented
2. **Upload a skill file** — Drop the relevant `.md` file into a Claude conversation to activate phase-specific workflows, templates, and quality checklists
3. **Do the work** — Claude follows structured outputs; you review, direct, and decide
4. **Carry context forward** — Each skill includes a Phase Handoff Block to pass structured outputs into the next phase without losing context

The [live site](https://quinrobinson.github.io/Agentic-Product-Design-Framework) has interactive tools for exploring the system, previewing design tokens, and auditing design systems. The [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/mrHuD7sY7h6uKSVndTSIQE) gives you a dedicated workspace per project.

## Before You Start

- **Claude access** — A claude.ai account (free tier works; Pro recommended for longer sessions)
- **Figma** — Optional but recommended. For MCP integration (Claude working directly in Figma), you'll need Claude Desktop + the Figma desktop app
- **The Figma template** — [Duplicate it here](https://www.figma.com/design/mrHuD7sY7h6uKSVndTSIQE) and fill in the Cover page with your project details
- **Skill files** — Available in `/skills`. Upload whichever phase you're starting in — or use the Kickoff Prompt below if you're not sure

---

## Kickoff Prompt

**Not sure where to start? Paste this into a new Claude conversation.**

No skill file needed yet — Claude will orient itself to the framework, ask you four questions, and tell you exactly where to start and what to do first.

```
You are a UX design assistant trained on the Agentic Product Design Framework —
a six-phase system (Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver)
with structured skill files, Figma templates, and AI-ready prompts for each phase.

The six phases and their skill files are:
- Discover → user-research.md, competitive-analysis.md
- Define → problem-framing.md
- Ideate → concept-generation.md, visual-design-execution.md
- Prototype → prototyping.md, accessibility-audit.md
- Validate → usability-testing.md
- Deliver → design-delivery.md
- Cross-phase → design-systems.md, figma-playbook.md

I'm starting a new design project and need help getting oriented.
Please ask me the following four questions (all at once is fine):

1. What type of project is this?
   (e.g., new product, feature addition, redesign, internal tool, client work)

2. What phase are you entering?
   (Discover / Define / Ideate / Prototype / Validate / Deliver — or "not sure")

3. What do you have so far?
   (nothing yet / a brief / a brief + research / existing designs)

4. Are you working solo or with a team?

Based on my answers, respond with:
- Recommended starting phase and a one-sentence reason why
- The specific skill file to upload next (exact filename)
- A suggested first deliverable — specific, not a category
- One prompt I can use right now, before uploading anything, to get started
```

> **Also in Figma:** The Kickoff Prompt lives on the **AI Toolkit page** of the [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/mrHuD7sY7h6uKSVndTSIQE) — the first block on that page. Duplicate the template per project and it's always one click away.

## What's Inside

### `/skills` — Claude Skill Files

Eleven structured `.md` skill files — nine organized by phase, plus a cross-cutting Figma Playbook and a Design Systems skill. Each contains workflows, templates, quality checklists, and guidance for integrating AI into that part of the design process.

| Phase | Skill File | What It Does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 01 — Discover | `user-research.md` | Research synthesis, interview guides, thematic coding, research briefs |
| 01 — Discover | `competitive-analysis.md` | Landscape mapping, feature benchmarks, UX pattern libraries |
| 02 — Define | `problem-framing.md` | HMW/JTBD/user stories, journey maps, MoSCoW prioritization, design briefs |
| 03 — Ideate | `concept-generation.md` | Five-Direction concepts, UI patterns, visual system directions, chart type selection |
| 03 — Ideate | `visual-design-execution.md` | Style selection, color token architecture, typography, spacing, motion, icon standards |
| 04 — Prototype | `prototyping.md` | Functional prototypes, touch targets, interaction timing, gesture safety, platform QA |
| 04 — Prototype | `accessibility-audit.md` | WCAG 2.1 AA audit for web + iOS (VoiceOver) + Android (TalkBack) |
| 05 — Validate | `usability-testing.md` | Test plans, task scenarios, findings synthesis, heuristic evaluations |
| 06 — Deliver | `design-delivery.md` | Component specs, iOS/Android/Web platform handoff packages, DDRs, release notes |
| 03 / 06 | `design-systems.md` | Design system audit & token documentation — M3 naming, cross-system comparison, Figma variable setup |
| All Phases | `figma-playbook.md` | Figma MCP integration — execute design work directly in Figma from Claude |

### `/artifacts` — Interactive React Components & Onboarding Deck

Five JSX artifacts that render as interactive tools, plus a team onboarding presentation:

- **`design-process-system.jsx`** — Clickable phase-by-phase system with AI prompts, skill docs, templates, and tool recommendations per phase
- **`design-tokens-system.jsx`** — Universal starter design system with tunable tokens, live component previews, presets, and AI-powered customization export
- **`design-system-checklist.jsx`** — Comprehensive audit checklist synthesized from Material Design 3, Atlassian, IBM Carbon, and Apple HIG — with Figma-ready prompts per item
- **`m3-token-reference.jsx`** — Interactive M3 token documentation for Button, Card, Text Field, and Navigation Bar — covers color roles, elevation, shape, typography, and spacing with Figma variable spec prompts
- **`onboarding-deck.pptx`** — 18-slide team onboarding presentation covering the framework's value, structure, and step-by-step setup. Designed to match the Figma Cover aesthetic: dark/light slide balance, phase colors (01–06) used consistently throughout.

### Figma Template

**[Agentic Design Process Template](https://www.figma.com/design/mrHuD7sY7h6uKSVndTSIQE)** — A 10-page Figma file you duplicate per project:
- Cover with project metadata
- Process Map overview
- 6 phase workspace pages (Discover → Deliver) with structured sections
- Design System token reference
- AI Toolkit with copy-ready prompts and skill file references

## The Design Process

```
Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver
   ↑                                              |
   └──────────── Iterate as needed ←──────────────┘
```

## AI Leverage Levels

Each skill is tagged with an AI leverage level:

- **High** — AI handles the heavy lifting (synthesis, generation, documentation). You review, refine, and direct.
- **Medium** — AI assists with structure and drafts. You bring judgment, context, and strategic thinking.
- **Low** — Fundamentally human skills (empathy, taste, stakeholder navigation). AI supports but doesn't replace.

## Contributing

To add or modify skills:
1. Follow the frontmatter format (`name`, `phase`, `description`, `ai_leverage`)
2. Include structured templates with clear `[PLACEHOLDERS]`
3. Add a quality checklist at the end of every skill
4. Keep skills actionable — workflows, not theory
