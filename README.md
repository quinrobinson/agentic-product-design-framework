# AI × UX Product Design Framework

A scalable, AI-integrated framework for product and UX design — from research through delivery. Built as a living system that evolves with your practice and scales with any project.

## Live Website

The interactive tools are deployed as a website via GitHub Pages:

**[quinrobinson.github.io/AI-x-UX-Product-Design-Framework](https://quinrobinson.github.io/AI-x-UX-Product-Design-Framework)**

No install needed — open in any browser and share the URL with your team.

The site includes all four interactive tools on a landing page, a skills library browser linking directly to each skill file on GitHub, and links to the Figma template and onboarding deck. Any push to `main` automatically rebuilds and redeploys via GitHub Actions.

## Quick Start — Kickoff Prompt

**New to the framework? Don't know which phase to start in?**

Copy and paste this block into a new Claude conversation. No skill file needed yet — Claude will orient itself to the framework, ask you four questions, and tell you exactly where to start and what to do first.

```
You are a UX design assistant trained on the AI × UX Product Design Framework —
a six-phase system (Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver)
with structured skill files, Figma templates, and AI-ready prompts for each phase.

The six phases and their skill files are:
- Discover → user-research.md, competitive-analysis.md
- Define → problem-framing.md
- Ideate → concept-generation.md, visual-design-execution.md
- Prototype → prototyping.md, accessibility-audit.md
- Validate → usability-testing.md
- Deliver → design-delivery.md
- Cross-phase → design-systems.md, figma-playbook.md

I'm starting a new design project and need help getting oriented.
Please ask me the following four questions (all at once is fine):

1. What type of project is this?
   (e.g., new product, feature addition, redesign, internal tool, client work)

2. What phase are you entering?
   (Discover / Define / Ideate / Prototype / Validate / Deliver — or "not sure")

3. What do you have so far?
   (nothing yet / a brief / a brief + research / existing designs)

4. Are you working solo or with a team?

Based on my answers, respond with:
- Recommended starting phase and a one-sentence reason why
- The specific skill file to upload next (exact filename)
- A suggested first deliverable — specific, not a category
- One prompt I can use right now, before uploading anything, to get started
```

> **Also in Figma:** The Kickoff Prompt lives on the **AI Toolkit page** of the [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/mrHuD7sY7h6uKSVndTSIQE) — the first block on that page. Duplicate the template per project and it's always one click away.

## What's Inside

### `/skills` — Claude Skill Files
Eleven structured `.md` skill files — nine organized by phase, plus a cross-cutting Figma Playbook and a Design Systems skill. Each contains workflows, templates, quality checklists, and guidance for integrating AI into that part of the design process.

| Phase | Skill File | What It Does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 01 — Discover | `user-research.md` | Research synthesis, interview guides, thematic coding, research briefs |
| 01 — Discover | `competitive-analysis.md` | Landscape mapping, feature benchmarks, UX pattern libraries |
| 02 — Define | `problem-framing.md` | HMW/JTBD/user stories, journey maps, MoSCoW prioritization, design briefs |
| 03 — Ideate | `concept-generation.md` | Five-Direction concepts, UI patterns, visual system directions, chart type selection |
| 03 — Ideate | `visual-design-execution.md` | **NEW** — Style selection, color token architecture, typography, spacing, motion, icon standards |
| 04 — Prototype | `prototyping.md` | Functional prototypes, touch targets, interaction timing, gesture safety, platform QA |
| 04 — Prototype | `accessibility-audit.md` | **NEW** — WCAG 2.1 AA audit for web + iOS (VoiceOver) + Android (TalkBack) |
| 05 — Validate | `usability-testing.md` | Test plans, task scenarios, findings synthesis, heuristic evaluations |
| 06 — Deliver | `design-delivery.md` | Component specs, iOS/Android/Web platform handoff packages, DDRs, release notes |
| 03 / 06 | `design-systems.md` | **Design system audit & token documentation** — M3 naming, cross-system comparison, Figma variable setup |
| All Phases | `figma-playbook.md` | **Figma MCP integration** — execute design work directly in Figma from Claude |

### Figma Playbook (MCP Integration)

The `figma-playbook.md` is a companion skill that works alongside any phase skill. It maps every design deliverable to concrete Figma actions Claude can execute via the Figma MCP:

- **Discover** → Research findings boards, persona cards, competitive matrices
- **Define** → Journey maps, design briefs, requirements boards
- **Ideate** → Concept cards, wireframe scaffolding, pattern references
- **Prototype** → Component creation, screen layouts, design system tokens
- **Validate** → Findings visualization, heuristic evaluation boards
- **Deliver** → Spec annotations, component documentation, decision records

Use it by reading the phase skill + the playbook together. The phase skill defines *what* to create; the playbook defines *how* to create it in Figma.

### `/artifacts` — Interactive React Components & Onboarding Deck

Four JSX artifacts that render as interactive tools, plus a team onboarding presentation:

- **`design-process-system.jsx`** — Clickable phase-by-phase system with AI prompts, skill docs, templates, and tool recommendations per phase
- **`design-tokens-system.jsx`** — Universal starter design system with tunable tokens, live component previews, presets, and AI-powered customization export
- **`design-system-checklist.jsx`** — Comprehensive audit checklist synthesized from Material Design 3, Atlassian, IBM Carbon, and Apple HIG — with Figma-ready prompts per item
- **`m3-token-reference.jsx`** — Interactive M3 token documentation for Button, Card, Text Field, and Navigation Bar — covers color roles, elevation, shape, typography, and spacing with Figma variable spec prompts
- **`onboarding-deck.pptx`** — 18-slide team onboarding presentation covering the framework's value, structure, and step-by-step setup. Designed to match the Figma Cover aesthetic: dark/light slide balance, phase colors (01–06) used consistently throughout.

### Figma Template
**[AI × UX Design Process Template](https://www.figma.com/design/mrHuD7sY7h6uKSVndTSIQE)** — A 10-page Figma file you duplicate per project:
- Cover with project metadata
- Process Map overview
- 6 phase workspace pages (Discover → Deliver) with structured sections
- Design System token reference
- AI Toolkit with copy-ready prompts and skill file references

## The Design Process

```
Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver
   ↑                                              |
   └──────────── Iterate as needed ←──────────────┘
```

## How to Use

### With Claude
Upload any skill file to a Claude conversation, describe your project context, and Claude will follow the structured workflows and output templates.

### As Reference
Each skill contains markdown templates you can copy directly into your project documentation, quality checklists to verify work before advancing, and frameworks for structuring your thinking.

### Per Project
1. Duplicate the Figma template
2. Fill in the Cover page with project details
3. Work through each phase, referencing the skill files and AI Toolkit
4. Customize the Design System page for your client
5. Use the interactive artifacts for live previewing and exploration

## AI Leverage Levels

Each skill is tagged with an AI leverage level:

- **High** — AI handles the heavy lifting (synthesis, generation, documentation). You review, refine, and direct.
- **Medium** — AI assists with structure and drafts. You bring judgment, context, and strategic thinking.
- **Low** — Fundamentally human skills (empathy, taste, stakeholder navigation). AI supports but doesn't replace.

## Contributing

To add or modify skills:
1. Follow the frontmatter format (`name`, `phase`, `description`, `ai_leverage`)
2. Include structured templates with clear `[PLACEHOLDERS]`
3. Add a quality checklist at the end of every skill
4. Keep skills actionable — workflows, not theory
