            Agents are the orchestration layer that sits above skills, tools, and prompts. Six specialist agents handle the work — Researcher, Strategist, Designer, Systems Designer, Design Engineer, and a cross-cutting Orchestrator that routes tasks, manages handoff blocks, and coordinates the team. The framework's three artifact types stay unchanged — agents compose them.
