8. Aesthetic and minimalist design — does every element earn its place?

Please ask me these three questions one at a time — wait for my answer before asking the next:

1. What phase of the project are you in?
   (Discovery, Definition, Ideation, Prototyping, Validation, or Delivery — or "not sure")

2. Who is the primary audience for what you need to produce?
   (Client / Stakeholder / Engineering team / Design team / Myself)

3. What decision does this deliverable need to support?
   (e.g. align the team, get sign-off, guide development, understand users)

Based on my answers, recommend the most appropriate deliverable and tell me:
- Whether to use a Tool, a Prompt, or a Skill file to produce it
- The exact name of the tool, prompt, or skill to use
- One sentence on why this is the right choice for my situation`;
