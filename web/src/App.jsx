Your first job is to collect the research materials — not to synthesize yet.

**Step 1: Understand what we're working with**
Start by asking:
1. Are these user interviews, stakeholder interviews, or a mix of both?
2. How many sessions do you have?
3. What decisions will this research inform — what does the team need to know or do differently as a result?

**Step 2: Collect the materials**
Ask the designer to share everything they have. Be specific:
- Interview notes or transcripts (paste them or upload the files directly here in Claude.ai)
- Interview guide or discussion script, if one was used
- Any screener or participant profiles
- Previous research or context documents that informed this round

Let them know they can upload multiple files, and encourage them to share raw notes — rough is fine. Collect one session at a time if it's easier.

**Step 3: Align on the output**
Before synthesizing, confirm what format is most useful:
- A narrative Research Brief for stakeholders?
- A structured insight log (themes, quotes, severity ratings)?
- A handoff doc for the Define phase?
- Or something else?

Ask: who is the audience for this output, and how will it be used?

**Step 4: Synthesize**
Once you have the materials and an agreed output format, work through the synthesis:
- Surface key themes that appear across multiple sessions
- Anchor every theme with direct quotes (verbatim — never paraphrase)
- Identify the most critical pain points and unmet needs
- Note anything that surprised the team or challenged prior assumptions
- Distinguish between what users said vs. what they did (if observation data exists)

**Step 5: Produce the output**
Generate the agreed deliverable in clean markdown. Always end with a **Handoff Block** summarizing the top 3 insights and recommended next steps for the Define phase.` },

- Who are the key actors — users, front-stage staff, back-stage staff, supporting systems?
- What's the trigger that starts the journey and the end point?

Then build the blueprint across five swim lanes:
1. **User Actions** — What the user does at each stage
2. **Front-Stage** — Visible touchpoints and interactions (UI, staff, communications)
3. **Back-Stage** — Invisible processes that support the front-stage
4. **Support Processes** — Internal systems, tools, and third parties

For each stage, also identify:
- **Pain Points** — Where friction exists
- **Moments of Truth** — High-stakes moments that make or break the experience
- **Opportunities** — Where design can improve the experience

- What decisions does this problem frame need to enable?
- Are there business constraints or non-negotiables to keep in mind?

Guide the team through four outputs:

1. **Problem Statements (×3)** — Generate three distinct problem statement formats:
   - User-centered: "[User] needs [goal] because [insight]"
   - Tension-based: "How do we balance [X] while ensuring [Y]?"
   - Opportunity-based: "The opportunity is to [change] so that [user outcome]"
   Then evaluate each and recommend one. Be specific — every statement must be concrete enough that a designer could sketch 10 different solutions to it.

2. **Pressure Test** — Challenge the recommended statement on four fronts:
   - Is the user real and specific enough?
   - Is the insight grounded in research, not assumption?
   - Is the scope achievable within this project?
   - Does it leave room for creative solutions?

3. **HMW Questions** — Generate 10 How Might We questions from the problem frame. Score and rank the top 5 on: specificity, actionability, and creative potential.

Start by confirming the problem frame is clear and specific. If not, ask 1-2 targeted clarifying questions.

Generate concepts across 5 angles:

**Angle 1: From the HMW Questions**
Generate 3 concepts directly addressing the top HMW questions. Each concept must describe: the core interaction model, what makes it distinct, and which HMW question it addresses most strongly.

**Angle 2: First Principles**
Strip away how this problem is currently solved. What would you build if no existing solution existed? Generate 2 concepts built from first principles.

**Angle 3: Analogous Domains**
Find a structural parallel in an unrelated domain (e.g., how a hospital handles patient handoffs, how a bank handles fraud detection, how a hotel handles check-in). Transfer the underlying principle — not the surface solution. Generate 2 concepts.

**Angle 4: Constraint as Catalyst**
Pick the tightest constraint (technical, time, accessibility, budget). Let that constraint force a distinctive solution. Generate 2 concepts.

**Angle 5: Be the User**
Inhabit the user's perspective. What would feel magical? What would make them say "finally"? Generate 2 concepts from pure user empathy.

Then: **Consolidate** — Remove duplicates, merge similar ideas, and produce a clean concept card set of 5-8 distinct concepts.

Each concept card:
- Name (memorable, descriptive)
- One-line description
- Core interaction model
- Key user benefit
- Primary risk or assumption

Work through three stages:

**Stage 1: Cluster**
Group concepts by the underlying approach or interaction model — not by surface similarity. Name each cluster in a way that captures the strategic direction. Aim for 4-7 clusters from 15-50 concepts.

**Stage 2: Map the Landscape**
For each cluster:
- What's the core bet? (The key assumption this approach depends on)
- What user need does it primarily serve?
- What's the key trade-off vs. other clusters?

Identify 2-3 key tensions in the landscape (e.g. "guided vs. open-ended", "fast vs. thorough", "individual vs. collaborative").

- 1-2 clusters to pursue in prototyping
- 1 cluster to keep as a backup direction
- Clusters to set aside (and why)

Start by understanding what's being specified:
- Is this a new component or an update to an existing one?
- What's the design system context — does a token system exist?
- What's the primary use case and what are the edge cases?

Produce a complete component spec document:

**1. Component Overview**
- Name, purpose, and usage guidance
- When to use / when NOT to use
- Relationship to other components (contains, is contained by, composable with)

**2. Anatomy**
- Label every element in the component (e.g. container, icon, label, trailing action)
- For each element: element type, role, required vs. optional

**3. Visual Specifications**
- Spacing (internal padding, gap between elements) mapped to design tokens
- Size variants with exact dimensions
- Color tokens for each element in each state
- Typography tokens
- Border, shadow, and radius tokens

**4. States**
Document every state with visual diff from default:
default / hover / focus / active / disabled / error / loading / success / selected

**5. Behavior & Interactions**
- Click/tap behavior
- Keyboard interactions
- Focus management
- Animation/transition specs (duration, easing, properties)

**6. Accessibility**
- ARIA role and required attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader copy for each state

**7. Edge Cases & Content Guidelines**
- Min/max content length
- Truncation behavior
- RTL layout behavior
- Responsive behavior

**8. Implementation Notes**
- Any performance considerations
- Known gotchas for the target tech stack

If the designer has Figma exports, screenshots, or existing specs to share, ask them to upload the files.

Output as clean markdown with code examples in the target framework where relevant.` },

Start by understanding the QA context:
- What's being QA'd — a new feature, a redesign, or a bug fix?
- What's the agreed design spec? (Figma link, Zeplin, or component spec document)
- What platform and devices were tested?
- Is this a pre-launch QA or a post-launch audit?

Guide the QA process systematically:

**1. Issue Log**
For every observation, document:
- **ID**: QA-001, QA-002...
- **Screen / Component**: Where the issue appears
- **Description**: What's wrong (be specific — not "button looks off")
- **Expected**: What the design spec says
- **Actual**: What was implemented
- **Severity**:
  - P0: Blocking launch (accessibility failure, data loss, broken core flow)
  - P1: Must fix before launch (visual regression from spec, broken interaction)
  - P2: Should fix in follow-up sprint (minor spec deviation, polish)
  - P3: Nice to have (preference, not a spec violation)
- **Screenshot needed**: Yes / No

**2. Summary Dashboard**
- Total issues by severity
- Screens or components with most issues
- % spec compliance (rough estimate)

**3. Launch Recommendation**
Based on P0/P1 counts:
- LAUNCH READY: No blockers, all P0/P1 resolved
- CONDITIONAL LAUNCH: Ship with P2/P3 tracked, P0/P1 resolved
- NOT READY: P0/P1 issues must be fixed first

**4. Developer Sign-Off Checklist**
A checklist of P0/P1 items for the developer to confirm fixed before launch, with space for sign-off initials and date.

If the designer has screenshots, recordings, or a Figma spec to share, ask them to upload the files.

Output as clean markdown with a table for the issue log and the checklist at the end.` },

Assumption audit — every assumption across desirability / feasibility / viability / usability. Risk rating (Critical / Major / Minor) and evidence (Validated / Partial / None). Top 3 ranked.

Adversarial review — three objections, each made as strong as possible: skeptical engineer (technical feasibility), risk-averse PM (scope and failure scenarios), resistant user (busiest, most change-averse version of the persona).

Competitive displacement — why would the persona switch? What's the switching cost? At what point does value outweigh cost?

// ── Path: Deliverable ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const DELIVERABLE_GUIDE_PROMPT = `I'm working on a product design project and need help figuring out the right deliverable for my situation.

Please ask me these three questions one at a time — wait for my answer before asking the next:

1. What phase of the project are you in?
   (Discovery, Definition, Ideation, Prototyping, Validation, or Delivery — or "not sure")

2. Who is the primary audience for what you need to produce?
   (Client / Stakeholder / Engineering team / Design team / Myself)

3. What decision does this deliverable need to support?
   (e.g. align the team, get sign-off, guide development, understand users)

Based on my answers, recommend the most appropriate deliverable and tell me:
- Whether to use a Tool, a Prompt, or a Skill file to produce it
- The exact name of the tool, prompt, or skill to use
- One sentence on why this is the right choice for my situation`;
