DECISION [N]: [Short title — what was decided]

Context:
[Why this decision needed to be made — what problem or constraint forced it]

Alternatives considered:
1. [Option A] — [brief description] — Rejected because: [reason]
2. [Option B] — [brief description] — Rejected because: [reason]
3. [Option C — what was chosen] — [brief description]

Decision: [What was decided — specific and unambiguous]

Rationale: [Why this option over the others — reference user research, technical constraints, or business requirements where relevant]

Tradeoffs accepted: [What this decision gives up — be honest about the downsides]

Future considerations: [When this decision should be revisited — what would trigger a change]

---

After all decisions:

ANTI-PATTERNS DOCUMENTED
[Design directions explicitly rejected — so future designers don't revisit them without new information]
- [Pattern] — rejected because: [reason] — would reconsider if: [condition]

OPEN DECISIONS
[ ] [Design question that was intentionally deferred — what information is needed to resolve it]

Rules:
— Document why, not what (the Figma file documents what)
— Be honest about tradeoffs — "we chose speed over completeness" is valid
— Flag anything that was decided under constraint that should be revisited later`,

    text: `Generate WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility annotations for these components and screens.

Feature: [name]
Components to annotate: [list]
Target: WCAG 2.1 AA

For each component, document:

COMPONENT: [Name]

ARIA role: [role — e.g. button, combobox, dialog, listbox, menu, navigation, region]
ARIA label: [if the visible label is insufficient or absent — e.g. aria-label="Close dialog"]
ARIA described-by: [if additional context is needed — e.g. aria-describedby="error-message-id"]
ARIA live: [if content updates dynamically — e.g. aria-live="polite" for status messages]

Keyboard behavior:
| Key | Action |
| Tab | [what receives focus / what is skipped — not interactive elements] |
| Enter | [primary action] |
| Space | [secondary action or toggle] |
| Arrow keys | [navigation within component — if applicable] |
| Escape | [dismiss / cancel / return focus] |

Focus management:
- Focus receives: [visual indicator — e.g. 2px solid #0066CC, 2px offset]
- After [action]: focus moves to [element]
- Focus trap: [Yes/No — if modal or dialog, focus must be trapped]
- Focus restoration: [after dismissal, focus returns to [trigger element]]

Screen reader announcements:
- On focus: "[what gets read — role + name + state]"
- On action: "[what gets announced — e.g. 'Dialog opened. Press Escape to close.']"
- On state change: "[e.g. 'Checkbox checked' / 'Loading' / 'Error: [message]']"
- On error: "[error message text + how to fix]"

Color and contrast:
- Text contrast: [minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text]
- UI component contrast: [minimum 3:1 for interactive elements and focus indicators]
- Information not conveyed by color alone: [confirm — if color is used to convey state, add icon or label]

Touch targets:
- Minimum size: 44×44px — [confirm or flag if smaller]
- Spacing between targets: [minimum 8px — flag if closer]`,

const DELIVERABLE_GUIDE_PROMPT = `I'm working on a product design project and need help figuring out the right deliverable for my situation.

Please ask me these three questions one at a time — wait for my answer before asking the next:

1. What phase of the project are you in?
   (Discovery, Definition, Ideation, Prototyping, Validation, or Delivery — or "not sure")

2. Who is the primary audience for what you need to produce?
   (Client / Stakeholder / Engineering team / Design team / Myself)

3. What decision does this deliverable need to support?
   (e.g. align the team, get sign-off, guide development, understand users)

Based on my answers, recommend the most appropriate deliverable and tell me:
- Whether to use a Tool, a Prompt, or a Skill file to produce it
- The exact name of the tool, prompt, or skill to use
- One sentence on why this is the right choice for my situation`;
