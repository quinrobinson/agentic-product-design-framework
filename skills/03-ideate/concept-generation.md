# Concept Generation & Ideation

Generate a broad range of design solutions, then converge on the strongest direction.

---


## Claude Surface

**Use Claude Chat** (`claude.ai`) for ideation, direction selection, and pattern recommendations.

Upload `concept-generation.md` with your Define Phase Handoff Block. Claude will generate
structured concept directions, UI pattern recommendations, and visual system options as text.
No Figma MCP or terminal needed for ideation itself.

> **Add Claude Code + Figma MCP** (with `figma-playbook.md`) if you want Claude to place
> concept cards, wireframe scaffolding, or direction boards directly into your Figma file.

## Concept Exploration

### The Five-Direction Method

For any design problem, generate concepts across this spectrum:

**1. Convention** — What most competitors do
- Study existing patterns; identify the "expected" solution users are familiar with
- Strength: Low learning curve. Risk: No differentiation.

**2. Improvement** — Better version of the existing pattern
- Take the conventional approach and refine the weakest parts
- Strength: Familiar but noticeably better. Risk: Incremental.

**3. Recombination** — Patterns borrowed from other domains
- How is this problem solved in other industries?
- Example: What if onboarding worked like a dating app? What if data entry was conversational?
- Strength: Fresh perspective. Risk: May not translate.

**4. Paradigm Shift** — Rethink the core interaction model
- Example: What if there was no dashboard? What if the interface was voice-first?
- Strength: Truly novel. Risk: High learning curve.

**5. Moonshot** — Zero constraints
- The ideal with unlimited technology, budget, and time — reveals the north star
- Strength: Reveals the aspiration. Risk: Not directly buildable.

### Concept Card Format

```
# Concept: [Name]

## Core Idea
[2–3 sentences describing the interaction model]

## Key Interaction
[The primary way users accomplish their goal]

## UX Pattern
[The foundational pattern — wizard, feed, canvas, chat, etc.]

## Visual Direction
[Style, mood, density — see visual system section below]

## Strengths
- [What makes this compelling]

## Risks
- [What could go wrong]

## Best For
[Which user segment or use case this serves]

## Open Questions
- [What needs validating before committing]
```

## UI Pattern Recommendations

### Pattern Selection Criteria

1. **Task complexity** — Simple task → simple pattern. Complex → progressive disclosure.
2. **Data volume** — Few items → cards. Many → table + filters. Huge → search-first.
3. **User expertise** — Novice → guided wizard. Expert → keyboard shortcuts.
4. **Frequency** — Rare → discoverability matters. Frequent → efficiency matters.
5. **Error cost** — High → confirmation, undo, preview. Low → inline, immediate.

### Pattern Reference

**Data Entry**
- Simple form: < 5 fields, single purpose
- Multi-step wizard: > 5 fields or requires guidance
- Inline editing: Frequent small updates to existing data
- Conversational: Context-dependent or unfamiliar to users

**Data Display**
- Cards: Visual content, scannable, variable length
- Tables: Structured data, comparison, sorting/filtering
- Lists: Sequential items, simple data, mobile-first
- Dashboard: Multiple metrics, overview + drill-down

**Navigation**
- Tabs: 2–7 parallel sections of equal weight
- Sidebar: Deep hierarchy, persistent navigation, desktop
- Bottom nav (mobile): 3–5 primary destinations (max 5)
- Breadcrumbs: Deep hierarchy with back-tracking needs (web, 3+ levels)

**Selection & Input**
- Dropdown: > 5 options, single select, familiar
- Radio/chips: 2–5 options, need to see all at once
- Combobox: Large option set, search + select
- Toggle: Binary on/off, immediate effect

**Navigation Anti-patterns:**
- Mixing Tab + Sidebar + Bottom Nav at the same hierarchy level
- Modals used for primary navigation flows — they break the back stack
- Bottom nav with > 5 items or nested sub-navigation
- Navigation that changes placement by page type

## Visual System Direction

When ideating visual direction alongside interaction concepts, evaluate these dimensions:

### Style × Product Fit

Match visual style to the product's domain and audience:

| Domain | Recommended Styles | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| B2B SaaS | Minimalism, clean flat, subtle glassmorphism | Claymorphism, brutalism |
| Consumer / Lifestyle | Claymorphism, rounded, vibrant | Hard brutalism, dark-first |
| Fintech | Dark + deep blue, geometric, data-dense | Playful, rounded, pastel |
| Healthcare | Soft light, warm white, calm blue/teal | Dark mode, high-saturation primaries |
| Developer Tools | Dark mode, code-green, monospace elements | Soft pastels, rounded consumer styles |
| Creative / Portfolio | Brutalism, bento grid, typographic-led | Generic corporate blues |
| E-commerce | Brand-driven, warm, conversion-focused | Muted / cold / low-energy |

### Visual Concept Card

```
# Visual Direction: [Name]

## Style
[Glassmorphism / Minimalism / Claymorphism / Bento Grid / Dark / etc.]

## Color Mood
[Warm / Cool / Neutral / High-contrast / Pastel / Saturated]

## Primary Color Range
[e.g., Deep navy #0F172A with electric blue #3B82F6 accent]

## Typography Personality
[Geometric sans + humanist / Editorial serif + clean sans / Monospace-led]

## Density
[Information-dense / Airy / Balanced]

## Motion Personality
[Fluid + elastic / Crisp + instant / Subtle + purposeful]

## Strengths
[Why this direction fits this product]

## Risks
[What this direction trades off]
```

## Chart Type Selection

Choosing the right chart type is a design decision. Match the chart to the data relationship being communicated.

### Chart Decision Matrix

| Question | Best Chart Types |
|---|---|
| How does a value change over time? | Line chart, area chart, sparkline |
| How do categories compare? | Bar chart (vertical), horizontal bar |
| What's the part-to-whole relationship? | Donut chart, stacked bar (≤ 5 categories) |
| How are two variables correlated? | Scatter plot, bubble chart |
| What's the distribution? | Histogram, box plot |
| What's the geographic spread? | Choropleth map, dot map |
| What are the flow/connections? | Sankey diagram, network graph |
| How does a value compare to a target? | Gauge, bullet chart, progress bar |
| What's the ranking? | Horizontal bar chart (sorted), lollipop chart |
| What's happening right now? | KPI card, big number, sparkline |

### Chart Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Pie chart with > 5 segments | Impossible to compare similar-sized slices | Use horizontal bar chart, sorted |
| 3D charts | Distorts data — angles misrepresent values | Use 2D always |
| Dual-axis charts | Misleading — scales suggest false correlation | Use two separate charts |
| Relying on color alone | Fails for colorblind users | Add patterns, labels, or shapes |
| No zero baseline on bar charts | Makes small differences appear huge | Start Y axis at 0 |
| Too many data series on one chart | Visual clutter — no signal | Limit to 5–6 series; provide toggle |

### Chart UX Standards

- **Legend**: Always visible, positioned near the chart (not below a scroll fold); interactive to toggle series
- **Tooltips**: On hover (web) / tap (mobile) — show exact values; must be keyboard-accessible
- **Axis labels**: Include units; readable at mobile scale; auto-skip when crowded
- **Empty state**: "No data yet" + guidance — never a blank or broken chart frame
- **Loading state**: Skeleton or shimmer placeholder — never empty axes
- **Color**: Use accessible palettes — avoid red/green only; supplement with patterns/labels
- **Responsive**: Charts must reflow on small screens (horizontal bar instead of vertical, fewer ticks)
- **Screen reader**: Provide text summary or `aria-label` describing the chart's key insight
- **Large datasets**: For 1000+ data points, aggregate; provide drill-down for detail

2. [Principle]: [What it means in practice]
3. [Principle]: [What it means in practice]

## Typography
- Display: [Font, weight] — hero headings
- Heading: [Font, weight] — section titles
- Body: [Font, weight, minimum 16px web] — paragraph text
- Mono: [Font, weight] — code, data
- Scale ratio: [1.25 Major Third / 1.333 Perfect Fourth]

## Color
- Primary: [Token] — brand, primary actions
- Secondary: [Token] — supporting elements
- Success / Warning / Error / Info: [Tokens] — semantic feedback
- Neutral scale: [50–900] — structure and hierarchy
- Surface: primary, secondary, tertiary (light + dark variants)

## Spacing
- Base unit: 4px
- Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96

## Shape
- Border radius philosophy: [Sharp = precision / Rounded = friendly]
- Scale: sm (4px) / md (8px) / lg (12px) / pill (9999px)

## Elevation
- Level 1: Cards, dropdowns
- Level 2: Modals, floating panels
