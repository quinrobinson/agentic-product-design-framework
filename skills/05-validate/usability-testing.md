description: Plan, run, and analyze usability tests and heuristic evaluations. Use this skill when the user needs to create test plans, write task scenarios, analyze test results, conduct heuristic reviews, or synthesize usability findings into actionable recommendations. Also triggers for A/B test planning, success metrics definition, severity ranking of issues, or when the user mentions user testing, validation, or evaluation of designs.

# Usability Testing & Validation

Test designs with real people and evaluate against established heuristics to find and fix problems before launch.


## Claude Surface

**Use Claude Chat** (`claude.ai`) for this entire workflow.

Upload `usability-testing.md` with your prototype link or session notes. Claude writes
test plans, task scenarios, and findings reports conversationally. No installation needed.

> **Add Claude Cowork** if you want Claude to observe a live prototype session on your
> screen alongside you — watching a participant navigate and flagging issues in real time.

## When to Use

- Planning a usability test (moderated or unmoderated)
- Writing task scenarios that don't lead participants
- Analyzing raw test session notes into structured findings
- Conducting a heuristic review as a quick quality check
- Prioritizing issues by severity and frequency

## Test Planning

### Usability Test Plan

```
# Usability Test Plan: [Feature/Product]

## Objectives
What we want to learn:
1. [Primary question — the most important thing to answer]
2. [Secondary question]
3. [Secondary question]

## Hypothesis
We believe [assumption]. This test will tell us if [what we'll observe if true vs. false].

## Methodology
- Type: [Moderated remote / Moderated in-person / Unmoderated]
- Tool: [Zoom + screen share / Maze / UserTesting / Lookback / etc.]
- Duration: [30-60 minutes per session]
- Recording: [Video + audio + screen / Notes only]

## Participants
- Number: [5-8 for qualitative, more for quantitative]
- Profile: [Key characteristics — role, experience level, demographics]
- Must have: [Critical criteria]
- Must NOT have: [Exclusion criteria]
- Recruitment: [How to find them]

## Screener Questions
1. [Question to verify they match the profile]
2. [Question to ensure they're not biased]
3. [Question to confirm relevant experience]

## Task Scenarios
[See task writing guidelines below]

## Success Metrics
- Task completion rate: [Target %]
- Time on task: [Benchmark in minutes]
- Error rate: [Acceptable threshold]
- Satisfaction: [SUS score / Likert scale target]

## Schedule
- Pilot test: [Date] — Run 1 session to catch issues with the plan itself
- Sessions: [Date range]
- Analysis: [Duration after last session]
- Readout: [Date for team presentation]
```

### Writing Good Task Scenarios

Tasks should feel natural, not like instructions. They should set a scenario, not dictate steps.

**Bad task:**
> "Click on Settings, then go to Account, then change your email address."

**Good task:**
> "You recently changed your email provider and need to update the email address associated with your account. Go ahead and do that."

**Task writing rules:**
- Set context with a realistic scenario, not a UI instruction
- Use the user's language, not your product's terminology
- Don't reveal the answer — "find the settings" vs "click the gear icon"
- Include the motivation — why would someone actually do this?
- Test one thing per task when possible
- Order tasks from easy to hard to build confidence

### Task Template

```

## Task [N]: [Short name for your notes]

### Scenario
[The realistic situation you describe to the participant]

### What we're testing
[The internal question this task answers — NOT shared with participant]

### Success criteria
- [ ] Completed without assistance
- [ ] Completed with minor hint
- [ ] Completed with significant help
- [ ] Not completed

### Metrics to capture
- Time to complete: [start → end]
- Errors: [wrong clicks, backtracking, confusion]
- Satisfaction: [post-task rating 1-5]

### Probing questions (after task)
- "How did that go?"
- "What did you expect to happen when you [action]?"
- "Was anything confusing?"
```

## Session Facilitation Guide

### Before the Session
- Test the prototype/product yourself — know where things break
- Test screen sharing, recording, and backup plans
- Have the discussion guide printed/visible
- Prepare consent form and compensation details

### During the Session

**Opening (5 min)**
- Thank them for participating
- Explain the purpose: "We're testing the design, not you"
- Ask them to think aloud
- Confirm recording consent

**Tasks (30-40 min)**
- Read each scenario naturally (don't recite robotically)
- Stay quiet — resist the urge to help
- Observe body language and hesitations
- Ask follow-up questions after each task, not during
- Use these recovery phrases:
  - "What are you looking for?" (when they're stuck)
  - "What would you normally do here?" (to understand expectations)
  - "Take your time" (to reduce performance anxiety)

**Wrap-up (5-10 min)**
- "What stood out to you about this experience?"
- "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
- "Is there anything we didn't cover that you expected?"

### Key Facilitation Rules
- Never say "You're doing great" (it implies judgment)
- Never explain how something works (you're here to learn, not teach)
- If they ask "Am I doing this right?" say "There's no right or wrong"
- Note exact quotes — these are gold for stakeholder presentations

## Analyzing Results
