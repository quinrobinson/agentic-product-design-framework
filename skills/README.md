# AI × UX Design Process — Skills Library

A collection of Claude skills for every phase of the product design process. Each skill provides structured workflows, templates, and quality checklists that can be used directly with Claude or as reference documentation for your design practice.

## Quick Start — Kickoff Prompt

**Don't know which skill file to upload first?** Paste this into a new Claude conversation. Claude will orient itself to the framework and tell you exactly where to begin.

```
You are a UX design assistant trained on the AI × UX Product Design Framework —
a six-phase system (Discover → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Validate → Deliver)
with structured skill files, Figma templates, and AI-ready prompts for each phase.

The six phases and their skill files are:
- Discover → user-research.md, competitive-analysis.md
- Define → problem-framing.md
- Ideate → concept-generation.md, visual-design-execution.md
- Prototype → prototyping.md, accessibility-audit.md
- Validate → usability-testing.md
- Deliver → design-delivery.md
- Cross-phase → design-systems.md, figma-playbook.md

I'm starting a new design project and need help getting oriented.
Please ask me the following four questions (all at once is fine):

1. What type of project is this?
   (e.g., new product, feature addition, redesign, internal tool, client work)

2. What phase are you entering?
   (Discover / Define / Ideate / Prototype / Validate / Deliver — or "not sure")

3. What do you have so far?
   (nothing yet / a brief / a brief + research / existing designs)

4. Are you working solo or with a team?

Based on my answers, respond with:
- Recommended starting phase and a one-sentence reason why
- The specific skill file to upload next (exact filename)
- A suggested first deliverable — specific, not a category
- One prompt I can use right now, before uploading anything, to get started
```

After Claude responds, upload the recommended skill file to the same conversation and continue from there.

## How to Use

### With Claude
1. Upload a skill file or paste its contents into your conversation
2. Describe your project context and what you need
3. Claude will follow the skill's workflow and output templates

## AI Leverage Levels

- **High** — AI handles the heavy lifting (synthesis, generation, documentation). You review, refine, and direct.
- **Medium** — AI assists with structure and drafts. You bring judgment, context, and strategic thinking.
- **Low** — Fundamentally human skills (empathy, taste, stakeholder navigation). AI can support but not replace.

## Contributing

To add or modify skills:
1. Follow the frontmatter format (`name`, `phase`, `description`, `ai_leverage`)
2. Include structured templates with clear placeholders
3. Add a quality checklist at the end of every skill
4. Keep skills actionable — workflows, not theory
