  Create component specifications, developer handoff documentation, platform-specific delivery
  packages, design decision records, and release notes. Use this skill when preparing designs
  for engineering handoff, writing component specs, creating QA checklists, documenting design
  decisions, building platform-specific annotation guides (iOS, Android, Web), writing release
  notes or changelogs, or producing design system documentation. Also triggers for any mention
  of shipping, handoff, specs, annotations, tokens in code, developer questions, or ensuring
  what was designed actually gets built correctly.

# Design Delivery & Documentation

Ship designs with precision and documentation that ensures what gets built matches what was designed.

## Claude Surface

**Use Claude Chat** (`claude.ai`) for writing component specs, platform handoff packages,
design decision records, and release notes.

**Use Claude Code** for pushing finished spec files to GitHub, generating token exports,
or annotating Figma frames directly via the Figma MCP.

| Task | Surface |
|------|---------|
| Write component specs and DDRs | Claude Chat |
| Generate iOS/Android/Web handoff packages | Claude Chat |
| Push specs and docs to GitHub | Claude Code |
| Annotate Figma frames with spec overlays | Claude Code + Figma MCP |

## Component Specification

Write specs so a developer can build the component without asking questions:

```
# Component Spec: [Component Name]

## Overview
- Purpose: [What this component does]
- Context: [Where it's used in the product]
- Related components: [Components it's used with]

## API / Props

| Prop     | Type                        | Default   | Required | Description              |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| variant  | "primary" | "secondary" | "primary" | No       | Visual style variant     |
| size     | "sm" | "md" | "lg"        | "md"      | No       | Size of the component    |
| disabled | boolean                     | false     | No       | Prevents interaction     |
| onClick  | () => void                  | —         | Yes      | Click handler            |
| children | ReactNode                   | —         | Yes      | Content to display       |

## Visual States

### Default — [Description]
### Hover — [Background/border/shadow/cursor changes] | Transition: [Xms ease-out]
### Active/Pressed — [What changes on press]
### Focus — [Focus ring: Xpx solid #color, offset Xpx] — must be keyboard-visible
### Disabled — [Opacity 0.38–0.5, cursor not-allowed, pointer-events: none]
### Loading — [Spinner / skeleton — still interactive? Y/N]
### Error — [Border color, icon, message — how it clears]

## Responsive Behavior

| Breakpoint  | Behavior                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| < 375px     | [Full width, stacked]          |
| 375–768px   | [Mobile behavior]              |
| 768–1280px  | [Tablet behavior]              |
| > 1280px    | [Desktop behavior]             |

## Accessibility

### Keyboard
- Tab: [Focus behavior]
- Enter/Space: [Activation]
- Escape: [Dismiss / cancel if applicable]

### Screen Reader
- Role: [ARIA role or native element]
- Label: [How it announces — visible text / aria-label]
- State changes: [aria-live announcements — what fires and when]

### ARIA Attributes
- aria-label: [When needed]
- aria-describedby: [For additional context]
- aria-disabled: [For disabled state]

## Content Guidelines

| Element     | Min | Max | Truncation   |
|-------------|-----|-----|--------------|
| Label       | 1   | 30  | Ellipsis     |
| Description | 0   | 120 | Line clamp 2 |

## Usage: Do / Don't
- Do: [Correct usage]
- Don't: [Anti-pattern]

## Edge Cases
- Empty content: [How the component handles no data]
- Maximum content: [How it handles overflow]
- Nested instances: [Behavior when stacked/combined]
```

## Platform-Specific Handoff

### Web Handoff

```
# Web Handoff: [Feature/Screen]

## Breakpoints
- 375px (mobile): [layout behavior]
- 768px (tablet): [layout behavior]
- 1024px (laptop): [layout behavior]
- 1280px (desktop): [layout behavior]
- 1920px (wide): [max-width container behavior]

## Viewport
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> — confirm zoom not disabled

## Performance Notes
- [ ] Images: WebP/AVIF with width/height declared (prevents CLS)
- [ ] Fonts: font-display: swap — list fonts to preload
- [ ] Code splitting: lazy-load routes listed here: [list]
- [ ] Lists with > 50 items: virtualization required
- [ ] Below-fold images: loading="lazy"

## CSS Architecture
- Color: semantic tokens only — no raw hex in components
- Spacing: 4pt grid — all values multiples of 4
- Z-index scale: [0 / 10 / 20 / 40 / 100 / 1000]
- Fixed elements: reserve [Xpx] top / bottom padding for underlying scroll content

## Animations
- Properties: transform and opacity only
- Timing: [list interactions with durations]
- prefers-reduced-motion: [list fallback behaviors]
```

### iOS Handoff

```
# iOS Handoff: [Feature/Screen]

## Safe Areas
- Top: respect status bar and Dynamic Island
- Bottom: respect home indicator (typically 34pt on modern devices)
- All fixed headers, tab bars, and CTA bars must avoid these zones
- Use SafeAreaInsets or safeAreaLayoutGuide

## Navigation
- Primary navigation: Tab Bar (bottom) — max 5 items, icon + label required
- Back navigation: support swipe-back gesture — do NOT override UINavigationController default
- Modals: swipe-down to dismiss — include visual drag handle
- Deep links: list all screens that must support deep linking

## Typography
- Support Dynamic Type — avoid fixed-height containers that clip text at large sizes
- Preferred font: SF Pro (system font) — specify size in Dynamic Type categories:
  - Body: .body | Caption: .caption1 | Title: .title1 etc.
- Never truncate system-size text without tooltip access to full content

## Controls
- Touch target minimum: 44×44pt — use hitSlop if visual element is smaller
- Use native UIKit controls where possible before custom implementations
- Haptic feedback: UIImpactFeedbackGenerator for confirmations; UINotificationFeedbackGenerator for success/error

## Icons
- Use SF Symbols where appropriate (ensure they meet minimum weight at all sizes)
- Custom icons: SVG-based, consistent stroke weight

## Accessibility (VoiceOver)
- Every interactive element: accessibilityLabel + accessibilityTraits
- accessibilityHint for non-obvious actions
- Set accessibilityElements array if auto-order is incorrect
- Test reading order manually with VoiceOver enabled
```

### Android Handoff

```
# Android Handoff: [Feature/Screen]

## Safe Areas
- Status bar: respect height (varies by device — use WindowInsetsCompat)
- Navigation bar: respect gesture navigation area at bottom
- All sticky bars must add bottom inset padding

## Navigation
- Primary: Top App Bar with navigation icon for main structure
- Secondary destinations: Navigation Drawer
- Bottom Navigation: only for 3–5 top-level tabs with icon + label
- Predictive back: support Android 13+ predictive back gesture — do NOT intercept back stack
- Deep links: list all Activities/Fragments that must declare intent-filter

## Typography
- Minimum body: 14sp (16sp preferred)
- Follow Material Type scale roles: displayLarge, headlineMedium, bodyMedium, labelSmall
- Support font scale multiplier — test at 1.0× and 1.3× minimum

## Controls
- Touch target minimum: 48×48dp — extend with padding if icon is smaller
- State layers: use Material state overlays (hover, pressed, focused, dragged, selected) at correct opacities
- Ripple: default ripple on all interactive surfaces

## Color
- Use Material Color Roles: Primary, OnPrimary, PrimaryContainer, Surface, OnSurface, etc.
- Support both light and dark themes using MaterialTheme.colorScheme
- Never hardcode hex values in components

## Accessibility (TalkBack)
- contentDescription on all non-text interactive elements
- importantForAccessibility="no" for decorative elements
- traversalBefore/After for non-standard reading order
- Test with TalkBack enabled
```

## Design Decision Records

Document significant design decisions so the team understands *why*, not just *what*:

```
# DDR-[NNN]: [Decision Title]

## Status: Accepted / Superseded by DDR-[NNN] / Deprecated

## Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context
[What prompted this decision? What problem were we solving?]

## Decision
[What we decided, stated clearly.]

## Options Considered

### Option A: [Name]
Pros: [Benefits] | Cons: [Drawbacks]

### Option B: [Name] ← Selected
Pros: [Benefits] | Cons: [Drawbacks]

## Rationale
[Why Option B. What tradeoffs we accepted and why.]

## Consequences
[What this enables / constrains / risks]

## Related: DDR-[NNN], [research link]
```

Write a DDR whenever: you chose between meaningful alternatives; a stakeholder might ask "why"; the decision constrains future options; you're reversing a previous decision.
