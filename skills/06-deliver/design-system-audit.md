  Audit a product's design system before handoff against four industry standards —
  Google Material Design 3, Atlassian, IBM Carbon, and Apple HIG. Covers foundations,
  core components, complex patterns, accessibility, documentation, and AI acceleration.
  Use at the end of a project cycle when preparing for engineering handoff, design system
  release, or cross-team documentation. Not a discovery or ideation tool — run this when
  the system is built and needs to be validated before shipping.

# Design System Audit

Validate your design system is complete, accessible, and documented before it ships.
Run this checklist when you are preparing for engineering handoff or a design system release.

---


## Claude Surface

**Use Claude Chat** (`claude.ai`) for running the design system audit.

Upload `design-system-audit.md` with your component documentation, Figma screenshots,
or token files. Claude audits against Material Design 3, Atlassian, IBM Carbon, and
Apple HIG conversationally, producing a severity-ranked gap report.

> **Add Claude Code** if you want to push token fixes or updated spec files to
> your design system repo after the audit is complete.

## How to Use This Skill

Upload this file to Claude at the start of a Deliver phase audit session.

**Prompt to start:**
```
I'm auditing [PRODUCT NAME]'s design system before handoff. Use this skill file to walk me through each section — Foundations, Core Components, Complex Patterns, Accessibility, Documentation, and AI Acceleration. For each item, ask me to confirm whether it exists, is partial, or is missing. At the end, generate a gap report and a prioritized action list.
```

**Status markers:**
- ✅ Exists and documented
- ⚠️ Partially complete — needs work
- ❌ Missing — needs to be created

---

## Section 5 — Documentation & Handoff

### Component usage guidelines
Each component has: when to use, when not to use, dos and don'ts.

**Figma prompt:**
```
Write usage guidelines for the [COMPONENT NAME] component: a one-sentence description, 3 when-to-use cases, 3 when-not-to-use cases, and a do/don't comparison frame.
```

---

### Design tokens mapped to code
Token names in Figma match token names in the codebase. CSS variables or style-dictionary config exists.

**Figma prompt:**
```
Generate a CSS custom property token file from the Figma variable collection. Match variable names exactly — no renaming. Output as :root { --token-name: value; } blocks by category.
```

---

### Figma component anatomy annotated
Each component frame has layer annotations showing spacing, token names, and state logic.

**Figma prompt:**
```
Create a component anatomy annotation frame for [COMPONENT NAME] in Figma: label each layer with its token reference, show spacing values with dimension annotations, and mark each variant trigger.
```

---

### Variant & property matrix complete
All component variants are exposed as Figma properties (variant, boolean, instance swap, text).

**Figma prompt:**
```
Audit the [COMPONENT NAME] Figma component for missing property coverage. List every visual state and variant, then identify which ones are not yet exposed as component properties.
```

---

### Changelog maintained
A changelog exists documenting what changed between design system versions.

**Prompt:**
```
Write a changelog entry for this design system release. Format: version number, release date, sections for Added / Changed / Fixed / Deprecated. Pull from our recent Figma changes and component updates.
```

---

## Section 6 — AI Acceleration

### AI prompt library per component
Each component has tested Claude prompts for generation, audit, and documentation.

**Prompt:**
```
Create a prompt library for [COMPONENT NAME]: one prompt to generate the component in Figma via MCP, one to audit an existing implementation against the design system, and one to write the component spec for developer handoff.
```

---

### Component generation tested
AI-generated components have been validated against the design system for token accuracy.

**Prompt:**
```
Generate [COMPONENT NAME] in Figma using the design system variable collections. After generating, audit the result: check every fill, stroke, spacing value, and typography style against the token library and list any deviations.
```

---

### System prompt crafted for design context
A CLAUDE.md or system prompt exists that gives Claude full design system context for this project.

**Prompt:**
```
Based on this design system, write a CLAUDE.md system prompt that gives an AI agent full context: token names and values, component rules, spacing scale, typography scale, accessibility requirements, and Figma MCP binding instructions.
```

---

### Design-to-dev handoff accelerated
Claude has been used to generate component specs, QA checklists, and handoff documentation.

**Prompt:**
```
Generate a complete developer handoff spec for [COMPONENT NAME]: props table, state matrix, token reference, accessibility notes, and a QA checklist. Format for Notion or a GitHub markdown file.
```

---

## Audit Output — Gap Report

Run this prompt at the end of your audit session to generate a prioritized action plan:

```
Based on the audit we just completed, generate a gap report for [PRODUCT NAME]'s design system:

1. Summary — what % of items are complete, partial, or missing
2. Critical gaps — items that will block engineering handoff
3. Nice-to-have — items that improve quality but won't block shipping
4. Recommended order of completion — prioritized by impact and effort
5. Suggested owners — which gaps are design vs. engineering responsibilities

Format as a structured Markdown document I can paste into Notion or a GitHub issue.
```
